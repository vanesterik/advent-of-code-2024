# Advent of Code 2024

An attempt to solve the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Polars and possibly other tools. This to learn and improve my hands-on skills in data manipulation, and data analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run command `make requirements` to setup the environment
3. Run command `make run` to preprocess input data
4. Open project in VSCode
5. Open `day-<number>.ipynb` notebook to view solutions
